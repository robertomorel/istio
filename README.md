Website: <a>https://k3d.io/v5.4.6/#installation</a>

It's to help work with local kubernetes

> k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.

- Creating a cluster: `k3d cluster create -p "8000:30000@loadbalancer" --agents 2`
  - Accessing p8000 will be redirected to 30000
  - "agents 2": two nodes
- Changing the context: `kubectl config use-context k3d-k3s-default`
- Getting nodes: `kubectl get nodes`
